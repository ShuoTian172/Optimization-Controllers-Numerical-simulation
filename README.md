# OPTIMAL CONTROL STRATEGIES FOR TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT
## Optimization-Controllers-Numerical simulation-Matlab
- Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted by airborne particles and tuberculosis (TB) infection results when the mycobacterium is deposited in the lungs of exposed persons. TB is an important health issue all over the world, particularly in many African countries. This paper focused on Angola, it is recognized by authorities that TB is the most serious public health problems. Efforts to control TB in Angola have been underway since 1981, but results are still not satisfactory, and minimizing the effects caused by TB is an important challenge. Implemented measures to control these problems are having a positive effect. 
- In this project the optimal control theory was applied to a tuberculosis model given by a system of ordinary differential equations. Optimal control strategies are proposed to minimize the cost of interventions. Numerical simulations are given using data from Adngola Luanda Sanatorium Hospital.
